# Array_mainlobe_beamwidth_maximization
## Introduction
This repository contains a code implementation and array excitation associated with the figures and tables in the manuscript "An Array Mainlobe Beamwidth Maximization Method with Desired Minimum Mainlobe Power Gain via Relaxation Optimization".

## Relevant Data
The array excitation associated with figures and tables of the manuscript are stored in the directory `.../Data/Array_excitation`. The excitation is saved in individual Excel files, categorized by chart number and legend label. For example, the file located in `.../Data/Array_excitation/Fig.3/SBPS_11.xlsx` corresponds to the array excitation of the algorithm $`\text{SBPS}_{11}`$ plotted in Fig. 3 for different scenarios.

The active element pattern generated by the full-wave simulator for array elements is stored in the directory `.../Data/AEP`.
