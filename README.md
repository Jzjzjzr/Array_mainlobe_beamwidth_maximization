# Array_mainlobe_beamwidth_maximization
## Introduction
This repository contains a code implementation and array excitation associated with the figures and tables of the manuscript "An Array Mainlobe Beamwidth Maximization Method with Desired Minimum Mainlobe Power Gain via Relaxation Optimization".

## Relevant Data
The array excitation associated with to figures and tables of the manuscript are stored in the directory `.../Data/Array excitation`. All the excitation is saved in individual Excel files, categorized by chart number and legend label.For example, the folder located in `.../Data/Array excitation/Fig.3/SBPS_11` corresponds to the array excitation of the algorithm `$SBPS_{11}$` plotted in Fig. 3 for different scenarios.

The active element pattern generated by the full-wave simulator for array elements is recorded in the directory `.../Data/AEP`.
