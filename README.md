# Array_mainlobe_beamwidth_maximization
## Introduction
This repository contains a code implementation and array excitation associated with the figures and tables in the manuscript "An Array Mainlobe Beamwidth Maximization Method with Desired Minimum Mainlobe Power Gain via Relaxation Optimization".  

Link to the manuscript:
## Code
The MATLAB source code of the proposed algorithm(Algorithm 1) is available in the folder `/Code`. To facilitate result reproduction, complete implementations for generating the results in Fig. 4 and Fig. 6 of the manuscript are provided.
  
Specifically, the files named `Fig4_a.m` $\sim$ `Fig4_d.m` and files such as the file `proposed_algorithm.m` contains the files named like `Fig4_a.m`$\sim$ `Fig4_d.m`, `Fig6_a.m` contain the implementation code for the results presented in Fig. 4 and Fig. 6, respectively.
## Relevant Data
The array excitation associated with figures and tables of the manuscript is provided in the directory `/Data/Array_excitation`. The excitation is saved in individual Excel files, categorized by chart number and legend label. For example, the file located in `/Data/Array_excitation/Fig.4/SBPS_11.xlsx` records the array excitation of the algorithm $`\text{SBPS}_{11}`$ plotted in Fig. 4 for different scenarios.

The active element pattern generated by the full-wave simulator for array elements with the EM model and relevant array parameters are provided in the directory `/Data/AEP`.
